Different markers are created using GUI and processing library that points to depth of Earthquake.
It also differentiates between land and occeanic Earthquakes.
Using the concepts of object oriented programming the above code was designed.
Unfolding maps library was used to navigate through world map.
Applets are used to implement GUI also responsilbe for the visual output.
