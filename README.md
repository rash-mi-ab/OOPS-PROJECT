# OOPS-PROJECT
The following code is a series of classes in java that implement the visual representation of world map with markers on different cities indicating the Earthquake occurances.
Different markers are created using GUI and processing library that points to depth of Earthquake.
It also differentiates between land and occeanic Earthquakes.
Using the concepts of object oriented programming the above code was designed.
Unfolding maps library was used to navigate through world map.
Applets are used to implement GUI also responsilbe for the visual output.

# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

* Eclipse IDE with jdk jave version 8 or lesser (to support applets).
* Data and library files.
* _unfolding maps and preprocessing library_
* java basics

# PROJECT OUTPUT

the above image is what our output looks like. 
However, while running our code in Eclipse and when viewed in applet user interface is more visible.
We can zoom in and out upto the levels specified in code we can also hover around the markers and click on it to show the information about intensity of Earthquake in that specific location in world map.
